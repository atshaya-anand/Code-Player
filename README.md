## Advantage 

The advantage of this editor over other editors is that it renders the output of the code in the adjacent panel. The user need not have to run the code. This shows the output as soon as the user starts editing the code!

## CRUX

Textareas have been used for the editable panels and the output is shown with the help of iframe. The output is updated correspondingly with the help of contents().
